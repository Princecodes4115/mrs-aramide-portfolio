					<description><![CDATA[Amazingggg!

Thank you for sharing your journey with us. This was such a beautiful read and I love how your childhood dream is playing out. 

You’re teaching through this blog, your books, your assignment during your MBA still being used as a teaching tool and your publishing company. 

Looking forward to subsequent blog posts.]]></description>
